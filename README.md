# Notion RichText Plugin

I created this plugin to port some of my favorite richtext shortcuts from Notion to Obsidian.
Here is a list so far

-   `[]-space` to create a unchecked checkbox
-   `[x]-space` to create a checked checkbox
-   `mod-shift-enter` to toggle checkbox status
    -   This is based on `shift-enter` Notion shortcut
-   `mod-v` to create a link when the clipboard contains a URL and selection is a range
-   `mod-shift-k` to create a local / relative link within your vault
    -   This is based on `shift-k` Notion shortcut
-   `mod-u` to toggle underline
